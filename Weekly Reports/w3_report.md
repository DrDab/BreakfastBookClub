weekly report!
# Breakfast Book Club Week 3 Status Report
## Team Report
- Last week’s goals: Set up database and API server. Agree on all API routes. Refine frontend and complete modals and popups. Establish SQL database tables and relations between them.

- Progress / Issues: Set up the backend API and database within the API. Also solidified all specific components of the backend and where they will live. Finished 95% of queries for the backend. Created API for backend database and connected all backend group members to this API so they have access to it on their local computer.

- Goals: Get backend setup finished - make sure the API is all set where all necessary group members have access to everything they need to work with the API. Start adding established queries into the API and start replacing some of the fake data on the frontend with real stored data.
