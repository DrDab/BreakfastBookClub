# Breakfast Book Club Week 5 Status Report
## Team Report
- Last week’s goals: Complete API routes for getting posts, and creating user profiles in the database. Film beta release presentation.

- Progress / Issues: We completed the create post and get posts use case. Now that we have a connection between the frontend and backend, it will be easier to create and integrate the remaining API routes. We were not able to complete as many test this week because we were focused on features for the beta release.

- Goals: Continue to connect our moving parts together. Build out remaining main API routes (get book data, get posts by book club, create and get user profile data). Impliment API routes into frontend.
