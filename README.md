# BreakfastBookClub

Breakfast Book Club is a social media site for book lovers. 
Users can join books clubs,
make post about theories, opinion and reviews, within the book club,
friend other users,
and recommend books.

The project directory is subdivided into frontend and backend folders. 
The frontend is broken into page components and resusable components such as people lists and book lists.
These subdirectories are further subdivided into their respective features.
